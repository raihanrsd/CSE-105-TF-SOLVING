/*
According to me getting the min and max from any heap at O(1) is not possible...
We can either get the min or the max value from a MinHeap or MaxHeap respectively.

Because in min heap the minimum value is always guaranteed to be at the top. 
While for getting the max value we need to search the heap at O(n) complexity.
